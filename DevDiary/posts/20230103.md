Created a basic project structure with a CDK application stack consisting of:

- 2 S3 buckets (source and destination)
- A test lambda function ("Markdown Processor") which responds to S3 PUT or PUSH events to the source bucket
- - it reads the contents of the file, and, for now, pretends to transform it into an HTML file
- - that output is then written to destination bucket

I briefly explored the Kotlin AWS SDK, but it's very coroutine heavy, which doesn't seem necessary in an event-driven Lambda world. I'm making the first git commit at this stage.
