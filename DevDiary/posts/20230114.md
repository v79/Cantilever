I had a painful couple of days trying to debug the application after I reverted to two, rather than three, S3 buckets. I couldn't seem to get an object from the source bucket in code, even though I could see the object, and could get it via the command line. In the end, I was mangling the object key at the last minute (after I logged "getting object with key xxx"). A simple mistake caused two days of suffering.
