To address some dev vs production issues, I've moved this editing environment to a separate subdomain, [app.cantilevers.org](https://https://app.cantilevers.org/). It makes a lot more sense and seems to behave.

Meanwhile, I have been working on all the new routes and API calls needed to properly support page and template editing in the web, though there's no UI yet.
