In order to support the syntax I would like, I have decided to fork the _lambda-kotlin-request-router_. The code change wasn't too complicated - just an additional type check and a bit more logic - but I had to make some tweaks to the project structure too to fix building and deploying. The [fork is available on github](https://github.com/v79/lambda-kotlin-request-router). I'm not entirely sure of the legality of this, but the source is under the *Apache 2.0 License* which allows modification and redistribution. But for my own private purposes, I am sure it's fine.

There is a weakness - it relies on an experimental feature of Kotlin which is [going to be removed](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-45375) from the language at some point. So it does have a limited shelf life.

I have enough to get going though, to build a RESTful API to my application. I've deployed and tested a basic route.

Next step is to add DI - dependency injection - and for that I will be using the [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) library. It's also a chance to start writing interfaces and implementations for the AWS access functions, to hide some of the complexity of making requests to AWS S3, for instance. I am not sure if I should put the interfaces and implementations in the _SharedModels_ module, or in a new module. Is there such as thing as too many modules?
