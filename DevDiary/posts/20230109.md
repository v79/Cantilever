It's Monday 9th January, so I'm back to work on the day job. This will significantly impact my progress with the *Cantilever* project.

I'm still thinking about my issues with S3 buckets and where to store the temporary files. If I store the temporary files in the _source_ bucket, then the FileUploadHandler will be fired every time I create a file there. If I store the files in the _destination_ bucket, then they will be available to anyone who knows or can work out the URL. And if I create a third, working folder bucket... that seems a little wasteful.

The only way I can think of doing it with just two buckets is to turn off website hosting for the destination bucket, then set up a Cloudfront distribution as my public route into the content. But I'd probably need to add Lambda@Edge functions to convert URLs like http://www.website.com/folder/ into http://www.website.com/folder/index.html - and I don't really like that idea. But it would allow me finer control of permissions in the destination bucket.

In the end, it seems a temporary working bucket is the most straightforward approach.
