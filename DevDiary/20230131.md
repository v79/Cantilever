So far all the functioning routes in the _Cantilever_ have been GET requests which trigger a process, sure, but do not add any new information to the application. This isn't much use - very soon I'll want to write the POST /new route, to create a new markdown source file.

But I can't have the application open to just anyone creating new files. They must be authenticated first.

I'm not very good at "auth"; I've only implemented it once before using Amazon Cognito, and I'm sure that's what I'll do again. But I've never written a router which requires authentication before, so I'm starting out by sketching out how I'd like it to work.

My preference is to have a mechanism like this:

```kotlin
override val router: Router = Router.router {
    // no authentication
    get("/noAuthRequires") { _: Request<Unit> -> ResponseEntity.ok("Welcome")}
    
    // authentication required
    authorize("PERMISSION_NAME") {
        post("/new") { request: Request<NewPost> -> ResponseEntity.ok("You have been approved to create post ${request.body}")}
    }
}
```

But I don't think I can make this work. Nesting these _RequestPredicates_ (as the _get_ and _post_ methods are internally) is proving very confusing. I have seen it done this way in the [Osiris library](https://github.com/cjkent/osiris) (for example, in [this class](https://github.com/v79/TheRightNotes-App/blob/master/core/src/main/kotlin/org/liamjd/rightnotes/core/ApiDefinition.kt) from an older project of mine).  The library which has inspired _Cantilevers_ handles authentication like this:

```kotlin
    post("/new"){ request: Request<NewPost> -> 
        ResponseEntity.ok("You have been approved to create post ${request.body}")}
        .requiresPermission("PERMISSION_NAME")
```

I might have to go down this path. But solving the nested _RequestPredicate_ issue will be essential for another feature I'd really like to add, route grouping:

```kotlin
    route("/news") {
        get("/", newsController::get) // matches path /news/
        post("/add", newsController::add) // matches path /news/add
    }
```

So the goal remains. Other libraries do support route nesting like this, and it would be a shame to lose that option.
