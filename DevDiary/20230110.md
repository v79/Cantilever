title: A File Upload Locking Issue

I may have a file locking problem... or rather, a lack of file-locking, and if I upload multiple markdown files at once, the *StructureHandler* may overwrite itself as multiple lambdas fire at once.

Options:
- Don't allow multiple file uploads at once (needs a UI and controls)
- - would have to move the *StructureHandler* out of the file upload handler, but that's no bad thing
- Don't try to update the structure until all the file uploads are done (how?)


## Update on buckets _20230112_

I have learned that I can apply a filter to Lambda S3 event triggers, so that they only apply for a given prefix. So I can configure the *FileUploadHandler* to only fire when files are uploaded to a particular folder, such as "sources". Then when new files are generated, they can be put in a different folder which won't trigger the lambda. I like that, and will probably want a folder structure like:

- `sources/` _for the markdown files_
- `templates/` _for the handlebars files_
- `assets/` _for css, javascript and the like_
- `media/` _for images and other user-uploaded documents_
- `generated/fragments/` _for generated HTML fragments prior to template processing_
- other `generated/` subfolders as needed.

This will mean I do not need the third, temporary bucket, which pleases me.

Once I introduce the concept of multiple projects, the structure may become `sources/<projectID>/` etc.
