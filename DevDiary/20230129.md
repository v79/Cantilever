Oh boy. I've put this off long enough. Time to start the web front end.

Task number one - choose a web front-end framework.

## Structure concerns

My project structure file has needed some tweaks (simplifications, really). But I have a more serious concern - the structure file is updated when a markdown file is uploaded to the source bucket. When multiple files are uploaded at once, there's a bit of [a race condition](/a-file-upload-locking-issue) and now the structure file becomes inconsistent, and usually missing some of the entries. I will need to change my approach to this, perhaps by adding a new SQS queue `updateStructure` (tough I am not sure if lambda will read all the queue items one-by-one, or try to run processes in parallel to consume the queue as quickly as possible.)

I definitely need to write an API to force a complete rebuild of the structure file too. Right now, to fix it I have to delete the file manually, then upload the markdown files one-by-one.

I am also increasingly worried that the lambda startup time is too great - fetching the structure file can take a long time, nearly a minute it seems.
