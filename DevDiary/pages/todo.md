## Current Branch

Not sure what the next priority will be. Probably the UI for pages, posts and templates.

## Priority Features

- Static assets, CSS, images
- Editing interface for pages and templates
  - _Learn about svelte routing? Or stick to SPA?_
- API route to clear out the `generatedFiles` folder

## Further down the line

- Monitoring generation progress
- Improvements to the editing interface
- Clearing cache/generated fragments

### Ideas and nice-to-haves

Ultimately, I would like to be able to separate the 'cantilever' application (front-and-backend) with this cantilevers.org blogging website.

## Historical branches
