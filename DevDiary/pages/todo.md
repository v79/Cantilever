## Current Branch

- **index-page**
  - ✔️ Creating index.html and general support for static pages
  - ✔️ API routes to regenerate named pages
  - API routes to regenerate pages based on templates
    - ✔️ This is missing a "page structure" file, the overall project map for pages.
  - ✔️ API routes to regenerate posts

## Priority Features

- Static assets, CSS, images
- Editing interface for pages and templates
  - _Learn about svelte routing? Or stick to SPA?_

## Further down the line

- Monitoring generation progress
- Improvements to the editing interface
- Clearing cache/generated fragments

### Ideas and nice-to-haves

- Work out why this is rendering `nice-to-haves` as `nice-to-hav`

Ultimately, I would like to be able to separate the 'cantilever' application (front-and-backend) with this cantilevers.org blogging website.
