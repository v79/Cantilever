**Cantilever** (or possibly _Cantilevers_), is an attempt to build a static website generator in the mold of _jeykll_, but running entirely on serverless infrastructure in the cloud. It was born from my frustrations with my earlier attempt at a static generator, [Bascule](https://www.liamjd.org/bascule.html), which I have used to build my own website.
