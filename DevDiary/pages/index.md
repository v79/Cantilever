Cantilevers is an AWS-lambda based static-site generator. This page was generated with an early version of _Cantilevers_. I can't quite decide if the project is called _Cantilever_ or _Cantilever**s**_.
--- #blockA
There's a web interface to the project at [Cantilevers.org](https://www.cantilevers.org). You need to be registered to use it.
